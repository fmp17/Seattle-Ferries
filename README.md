# Seattle Ferry Routes

## Infographic Objective and Design:

Our infographic aims to showcase the robust water vessel connections within Puget Sound. To craft this visual representation, we meticulously curated data from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) website. Our selection process involved choosing ferry routes with direct links to Seattle, as well as routes indirectly connected to Seattle through other nearby ports, such as the Annapolis to Bremerton route, which serves as a gateway to Seattle via Bremerton.

Determining the frequency of ferry routes was essential to understand their operational patterns. To accomplish this, we referred to data from both WSDOT and the King County website. We calculated the weekly frequency between ports by aggregating the number of trips each ferry made daily between January 12th, 2022, and January 18th, 2022. This sum was employed as the basis for the width values in our Sankey diagram. The variation in ferry operation frequency throughout the week necessitated this approach.

Calculating the capacity of each ferry was another crucial aspect, and we sourced this data from KitsapTransit. This platform provides comprehensive information about each vessel. For the population diagram, we turned to the United States Census Bureau. In the case of West Seattle, due to the Census Bureau's inclusion of its population under Seattle, we extracted the West Seattle population from Point2Homes.com and deducted it from Seattle's total. This adjustment was made to ensure that each port represented one circle in our diagram.

## Infographic Layout:

Our infographic layout is thoughtfully designed to convey how each port is interconnected, the key details about the connecting routes, and a comparative analysis of the population for each linked port. At the top, we prominently feature the Sankey diagram as it serves as the central information piece. In this diagram, each port is denoted as a node, and the links between them represent the weekly frequencies of ferry operation. We have also thoughtfully included the names of the vessels operating on these routes. Importantly, these links signify two-way ferry routes between the nodes.

Complementing the Sankey diagram, you'll find a table in the bottom-right section of the infographic. This table offers a more granular look at the data, providing precise numbers. Additionally, this table includes the passenger capacity of each vessel, a factor that significantly impacts the connectivity between the linked places. To further enhance this understanding, we introduced a multiplier. This multiplier is calculated by multiplying the total trips by the vessel's capacity. For instance, consider the Waterman with 204 trips and a capacity of 150, resulting in a multiplier of 30,600, while the Kittitas, with 122 trips and a capacity of 1,200, yields a multiplier of 146,400. This calculation provides a more accurate measure of each vessel's connectivity. Importantly, this illustration shows that the Kittitas excels in connecting its two ports compared to the Waterman.

Towards the bottom-right corner, you'll notice circles representing each port, with their sizes scaled in proportion to their respective populations. This visualization offers valuable insights into the significance of each port within the broader network.

In the top-right section, we've included a concise introduction to tie all the elements together and guide the reader on how these components interact.

## Significance and Target Audience:

Seattle, renowned for its maritime history, remains a vital port city. Ferries and intercoastal transportation are deeply woven into the fabric of both daily life and the tourist experience in the region. Our infographic serves a diverse audience, benefitting residents and visitors alike. Locals seeking to explore nearby islands or consider relocating will find valuable insights into well-connected places. For tourists embarking on ferry journeys, the infographic reveals the extensive interconnectivity of Seattle with the Puget Sound islands, offering a deeper understanding of the city's cultural and geographical ties.

## Project Experience:

Our journey throughout this project was enlightening and enjoyable. Effective communication within our group played a pivotal role in our success. Each team member performed admirably and was readily available to address challenges. Looking ahead, I aspire to adopt a more observant role, enabling quieter team members to contribute their valuable insights, thereby enhancing our group's overall dynamics.
